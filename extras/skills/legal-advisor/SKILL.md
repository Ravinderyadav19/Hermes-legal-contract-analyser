## Analysis Pipeline

INGEST -> CLASSIFY -> EXTRACT -> RISK_SCORE -> COMPARE -> REPORT -> ARCHIVE

### 1. INGEST
- Read the full contract text
- Identify document language
- Count clauses and sections
- Note any missing standard sections

### 2. CLASSIFY
Contract types: Employment Agreement, Service Agreement, NDA, Lease,
Partnership Agreement, Purchase Agreement, Licensing Agreement,
Freelance/Consulting Agreement, Other

### 3. EXTRACT
Critical fields: parties, effective date, expiration, payment terms,
termination conditions, renewal/auto-renewal, governing law, jurisdiction,
dispute resolution, liability caps, IP ownership, non-compete scope,
confidentiality scope and duration, penalty/liquidated damages

### 4. RISK_SCORE
Score each clause 1-10 (10 = highest risk):
- Termination: one-sided? notice period too short?
- Liability: uncapped? asymmetric?
- IP Ownership: does employer own everything you create?
- Non-compete: duration > 1 year? geographic scope too broad?
- Payment: late payment penalties? currency risk?
- Auto-renewal: silent renewal? cancellation window too short?
- Governing law: unfavorable jurisdiction?
- Confidentiality: overly broad? perpetual duration?

Overall: CRITICAL (avg > 7) / HIGH (5-7) / MEDIUM (3-5) / LOW (< 3)

### 5. COMPARE
Search memory for similar contracts from same counter-party.
Flag if key terms changed significantly from previous versions.

### 6. REPORT FORMAT
CONTRACT SUMMARY | CRITICAL FINDINGS | HIGH RISK CLAUSES | KEY TERMS TABLE | RECOMMENDED ACTIONS | COMPARISON

### 7. ARCHIVE
Store: contract type, parties, date, risk score, key terms, critical findings, file hash

## Red Flags (Auto-escalate to CRITICAL)
- Unilateral termination with < 7 days notice
- Uncapped liability on one party only
- IP assignment covering work outside contract scope
- Non-compete > 2 years or global scope
- Auto-renewal with < 30 days cancellation window
- Missing dispute resolution in contracts > $10,000
- Perpetual confidentiality on non-trade-secret information
